Description of the Topology
The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.
A load-balanced instance offers an application that will be highly available, while restricting access to the network.
Load balancers insure availability of servers and services


A jumpbox acts as a gateway to private servers, adding to our security and privacy. 
Utilizing an ELK server aids in monitoring VMs for changes.
